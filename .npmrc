# pnpm Security Configuration
# =========================
# Allow specific build scripts for essential native dependencies
# All other packages blocked by default (pnpm security posture)
#
# Rationale for allowed scripts:
# - esbuild: Native binary for Tailwind CSS compilation (dev mode)
# - sharp: Native bindings for Next.js Image Optimization (next/image)
#
