            ## Weekly Hygiene PR (Automated)

            This PR was created automatically by the repo-hygiene-weekly workflow.

            **Actions performed:**
            - Moved noise out of `.claude/` to proper locations
            - Archived non-core items
            - Updated `.gitignore` if needed

            **Policy:** No destructive deletes — only moves with git history preserved.

            Review the diff and merge if OK.
